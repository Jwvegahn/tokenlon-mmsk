# Installation
Download the latest [release here](https://github.com/consenlabs/tokenlon-mmsk/releases).

To be sure that the file **hasn’t** been tampered with, we suggest the market maker checks the downloaded zip file’s sha256 checksum, for example via: `shasum -a 256 /path/to/file`

After the check and un-zip is completed, enter the tokenlon-mmsk root directory, and execute:

`yarn` or `npm install`
